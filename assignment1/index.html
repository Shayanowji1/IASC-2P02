<h2>1.Flatness</h2>
<p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">from inside the cave...</span></p>
<p>From the point of view of people living in the cave day in and day out, there is nothing to live more than the shadow they see daily on the wall. It all started with only one faint circle shape that at times became brighter and sometimes just disappeared. But slowly there could be seen two extra shapes that are smaller in size compared to the first faint shape and they also move at different speeds and radiuses. The people in the cave believed these were some of the signs of the world ending. Why suddenly did the two other faint shapes appear? Where did they come from? Are they trying to destroy the big old faint shapes that we are used to seeing day in and day out? These are all the questions that are coming up in their head. Before they get any idea of what the shapes are, they see one-two new shapes that are appearing are not identical one moves slower and is smaller. Why is that? Are those shapes one child of the other? They see these shapes just appear for a limited time and then poof and go again. And this brings fear of what these shapes are doing here. Why do they keep coming and going?<span class="clickable" id="first-change">first weird faint shape!!</span><span class="clickable" id="second-change">    &nbsp&nbspsecond weird faint shape!</span></p>
<p>To me, Nick Sousain's concept of Flatness means living and seeing the world from one single point of view without having any deep-thinking thoughts about the reason and concept behind every issue that happens. It’s more like shallow thinking or seeing the surface of any issue that they face while the actual truth and reasoning will be always hidden behind all the extras that are happening at the surface. It's like the concept that makes you trapped in your single mind without knowing or even trying to see the full detailed image that there may be more to it than we know. People who lived in the cave their whole life all they knew was some faint shadow image without ever knowing what these sphere-shaped shadows were. When two other shapes appeared and disappeared all they thought about was the breakdown of order in their world. They used to be one shadow and now there are three. People usually get scared of what they can’t understand, and this is what exactly happened to see their issue on the surface, and without any critical thinking their first thought was either gods are angry at us or we are about to die and the end is near.</p>
<h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
<p><span class="clickable" id="part-two">from outside the cave</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, people outside the cave know what is exactly going on when they see the sun stand while 4 other planets are lined up behind it and rotate around it. The directional light from the sun shines what they see in their daily life. Their life is more than just a flat surface to any issue they face. They see that day in, and day out there are other planets that are orbiting around the sun with different behaviors, some are slower than others while some are orbiting around the sun with different radiuses. Each planet orbits in their path and they are never on their way to colliding with each other, this is a good metaphor for their society. Everyone lives their life at same as the planets that have a sun and they orbit around these people around their goals, gods, or the reason that drives them daily to live better. In the end people outside the cave, beauty is not in the shadows and the actual order and balance happens with the planets slowly working together to bring the light and shadows day in and day out.

  <span class="clickable" id="third-change">Third planet in solar system!</span><span class="clickable" id="forth-change"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp complete solar system!</span></p>
<p>Nick’s idea of Seeing Double for me is the realization that there are always two layers at any issue, or two worlds are unfolding around us that may be happening at the same time. This means there will be a shallow and very surface level of looking at the issue and then there is a more in-depth understanding of what is happening and the reason behind its occurrence. The appearance of shadows cave, people didn’t know what it was these shadows appeared when they were orbiting around the sun and when they were behind the sun there were no walls to cast the shadow on their shadow disappeared people in the cave thought of this as chaos and angry gods but people outside that we're seeing the complete balance of a solar system that by orbiting around the sun lights and shadows kept shining on the wall and disappear again. People in the cave also just see some shapes while being scared for their lives while people outside the cave see the full picture of the planets and this may mean that many people will fear what they don’t understand. In the end, people inside and outside the cave both live in the same world but they just look at the world in different understanding and that is solely because of layers they see the world some are in the shadows while some are in the bright sun light.</p>
